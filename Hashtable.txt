1. Performance of an instance of a hashtable is affected by: initial capacity and load factor(default to 0.75).

2. Fast fail: If a hashtable is structurally modified after an iterator is created, except the remove method
through iterator, a ConcurrentModificationException will be thrown. Don't rely on this, it is used for detecting bugs.
If a thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use HashMap in place of Hashtable.  If a thread-safe
highly-concurrent implementation is desired, then it is recommended to use ConcurrentHashMap in place of Hashtable.

3. The count field is transit int, which means this can't be serialized.
Transient is a variables modifier used in serialization. At the time of serialization,
if we don’t want to save value of a particular variable in a file, then we use transient keyword.
When JVM comes across transient keyword, it ignores original value of the variable and save default
value of that variable data type.

Transient keyword plays an important role to meet security constraints. There are various real-life examples
where we don’t want to save private data in file.
Another use of transient keyword is not to serialize the variable whose value can be calculated/derived using
other serialized objects or system such as age of a person, current date, etc.

Practically we serialized only those fields which represent a state of instance, after all serialization is all
about to save state of an object to a file. It is good habit to use transient keyword with private confidential fields
of a class during serialization.
