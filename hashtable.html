1. Performance of an instance of a hashtable is affected by: initial capacity and load factor(default to 0.75).

2. Fast fail: If a hashtable is structurally modified after an iterator is created, expect the remove method
through iterator, a ConcurrentModificationException will be thrown. Don't rely on this, it is used for detecting bugs.
If a thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use HashMap in place of Hashtable.  If a thread-safe
highly-concurrent implementation is desired, then it is recommended to use java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap in place
of Hashtable.
