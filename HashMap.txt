1. The initial capacity is 1 << 4 (16) and the default max capacity is 1 << 30.

2. The default load factor is 0.75, this value is used when it is not sepcified in constructor.

3. There is a tree threshold 0f 8.  It is bin count threshold for using a tree rather than list for a
bin.  Bins are converted to trees when adding an element to a bin with at least this many nodes. 
The value must be greater than 2 and should be at least 8 to mesh with assumptions in tree removal
about conversion back to plain bins upon.

4. Two critical methods to ensure correctly store key-value pairs. The hashCode() method and equals() method.
The equals method first check if two objects are having same addresses. Otherwise, it will check
if the corresponding key and value both are same. 

5. hashCode() method returns OXR(Objects.hashCode(key) ^ Objects.hashCode(value)).
The hash() method computes key.hashCode() and spreads (XORs) higher bits of hash to lower.
