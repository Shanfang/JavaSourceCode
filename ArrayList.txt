1. This class implements the List interface. It is similar to Vector class except that Vector is synchronized but
ArrayList is not.
2. It can store null.
3. Its iterator also has fail-fast behavior, and this should only be used to detect bugs.
4. The default size is 10, and will shrink and grow as needed.
